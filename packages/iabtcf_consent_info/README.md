Plugin for reading TCF v2.0 user consent information.

Consent Management Platforms (CMPs) such as [Funding Choices](https://fundingchoices.google.com/start/) provide SDKs,
which publishers embed into their apps. These SDKs make consent information available to other pieces of
software in a [standardized way](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/blob/master/TCFv2/IAB%20Tech%20Lab%20-%20CMP%20API%20v2.md).
This information can be read and listened to with the help of this plugin.
